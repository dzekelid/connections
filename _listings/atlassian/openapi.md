      summary: Get dashboard item property
      description: "Returns the key and value of a dashboard item property.  \n  \nA
        dashboard item enables an app to add user-specific information to a user dashboard.
        Dashboard items are exposed to users as gadgets that users can add to their
        dashboards. For more information on how users do this, see [Adding and customizing
        gadgets](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/7AeiLQ).  \n  \nWhen an app creates
        a dashboard item it registers a callback to receive the dashboard item ID.
        The callback fires whenever the item is rendered or, where the item is configurable,
        the user edits the item. The app then uses this resource to store the item's
        content or configuration details. For more information on working with dashboard
        items, see [Building a dashboard item for a JIRA Connect add-on](https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/guide-building-a-dashboard-item-for-a-jira-connect-add-on-33746254/)
        and the [Dashboard Item](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/modules/dashboard-item/)
        documentation.  \n  \nThere is no resource to set or get dashboard items.
        \ \n  \n**[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:**
        Permission to access Jira. However, to get a dashboard item property the user
        must be the owner of the dashboard or be shared the dashboard. Note, users
        with the _Administer Jira_ [global permission](href=) are considered owners
        of the System dashboard. The System dashboard is considered to be shared with
        all other users."
